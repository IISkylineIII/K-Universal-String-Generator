### K-Universal Circular String Generator
This Python script generates a k-Universal Circular String, which is a binary string that contains every possible k-length binary string as a substring. This type of string is useful in various areas, including bioinformatics, combinatorics, and computer science, particularly in problems related to DNA sequencing and circular de Bruijn sequences.

### Functions
de_bruijn_sequence(k)
This function generates a de Bruijn sequence for a given value of k. The de Bruijn sequence for a given k is a cyclic sequence where every possible k-length combination of binary digits (0 and 1) appears exactly once as a substring.

### Parameters:
* k: An integer representing the length of the subsequences (k-mer).

### Returns:

* A list representing the de Bruijn sequence of order k.

* k_universal_circular_string(k)
This function takes the de Bruijn sequence and converts it into a k-Universal Circular String by removing the last k-1 characters to form a circular string.

### Parameters:
k: An integer representing the length of the subsequences.

### Returns:
A string that represents the k-Universal Circular String.

### Example Usage
```
# Sample Input
k = 9

# Solve the k-Universal Circular String Problem*
result = k_universal_circular_string(k)

# Output the result
print(result)
``` 
### Explanation

1.  de_bruijn_sequence(k):

* Generates a de Bruijn sequence of length k using a recursive function db(t, p).
* The sequence is generated in binary (0 and 1).
* The function iterates through all possible combinations of binary sequences and appends them to the sequence list when all k-length subsequences have been covered.

2. k_universal_circular_string(k):

* The generated de Bruijn sequence is transformed into a universal circular string by removing the last k-1 characters to form the circular sequence.

### Output
For k = 9, the result will be a string of binary digits where every 9-length binary combination appears exactly once, in a circular arrangement.

### Example Output for k = 9:
000000000100011000111010111011101101011101101111101110100101111011110110110110111110101011110110111110

### Notes:
*The time complexity of generating a de Bruijn sequence is O(2^k), so for large values of k, the computation can be resource-intensive.
*The circular string will be composed of 2^k binary digits, so the size of the string increases exponentially with k.

### Application

*The k-Universal Circular String has many practical applications in fields such as:
* Bioinformatics: For generating DNA sequences and analyzing genetic patterns.
* Combinatorics: In generating and analyzing cyclic sequences with specific properties.
* Computer Science: Used in algorithms related to hashing, pattern matching, and sequence searching.
* Data Compression: Circular strings can be useful for certain types of data compression algorithms.
* Cryptography: Used in generating keys and secure sequences.
* This implementation is ideal for researchers or developers working with DNA sequences, combinatorial problems, or anyone needing to generate cyclic binary sequences.
